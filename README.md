<h1>Exploiting SSL Weaknesses: A Tactical Maneuver with Wireshark Insight</h1>
The SSL Heartbleed vulnerability, uncovered in April 2014 within the OpenSSL cryptographic software library, enabled attackers to exploit a flaw in the Heartbeat Extension implementation. This flaw permitted retrieval of sensitive data from server memory, including private keys, usernames, and passwords exchanged over SSL/TLS encrypted connections. Its widespread impact underscored the urgency of patching vulnerable systems and reinforced the necessity for strong security practices in cryptographic protocols.

The Metasploit console was accessed, initiating a search for Heartbleed-related modules. Subsequently, the appropriate module for exploiting OpenSSL Heartbleed was configured, setting the target IP and port parameters to the vulnerable machine's details. Execution of the attack via the "run" command confirmed successful exploitation.
